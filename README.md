hey, i'm olive.

i don't really host my code over here much, i really only have this account for working on repos with other people.
you can find my gitlab [here](https://gitlab.lunar-seas.uk:81/ollie5694) for viewing most of what i write in my free time.

i enjoy:
- sleep (when i'm able to get it)
- spending far too long playing videogames
- music
- deciding my operating system choice via multiple coin flips (it's a long story)

i do not enjoy:
- lack of sleep
- spending far too little playing videogames
- not music
- not deciding my operating system choice via multiple coin flips (it's a short story)
